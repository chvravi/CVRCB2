Hi Sir,

As you know from July on wards Maintenance has been reduced to 3400.
So, Total Rent is :

August Rent + Maintenance  =   19400
July Maintenance deduction = -   400
Clothes Hanger             = -  3400
Repair work                = -  1600
May Current Bill           = -   200

Total                      =   13800.
