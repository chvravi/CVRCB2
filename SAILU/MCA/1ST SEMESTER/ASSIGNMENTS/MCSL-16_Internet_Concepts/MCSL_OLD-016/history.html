The Indian capital city of delhiDelhi has a long history, and has been an important 
political centre of India as the capital of several empires. Much of Delhi's ancient 
history finds no record and this may be regarded as a lost period of its history. 
Extensive coverage of Delhi's history begins with the onset of the Delhi Sultanate in 
the 12th century. Since then, Delhi has been the centre of a succession of mighty 
empires and powerful kingdoms, making Delhi one of the longest serving Capitals and 
one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world.It is considered to be a city built,  

destroyed and rebuilt several times, as outsiders who successfully invaded the Indian 
Subcontinent would ransack the existing capital city in Delhi, and those who came to 
conquer and stay would be so impressed by the city's strategic location as to make it 
their capital and rebuild it in their own way.The core of Delhi's tangible heritage is 
Hindu,  
Islamic (spanning over seven centuries of Islamic rule over the city) with some 
British-era architecture in Lutyens'  
 
Delhi dating to the British rule in India.
