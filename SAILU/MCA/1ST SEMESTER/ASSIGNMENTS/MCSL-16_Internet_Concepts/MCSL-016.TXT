<h1>Some of the major festivals of Delhi are:<h1> 
 
<h2>Bhai Dooj Festival</h2> 
<p> Bhai Dooj Festival is celebrated in the month of October or November. The date 
is not fixed and is calculated every year by the Pandits. It falls on the new moon night, 
approximately one day after the festival of Diwali. The name Bhai Dooj, with "bhai" 
meaning brother and "dooj" meaning the second day after the new moon (the day of 
the festival), literally means the day of the brother. Bhai Dooj is also known as the 
festival of Tikka. 
 
<h2>Chhat Festival</h2> 
 The Chhath Festival is basically a major festival of Bihar, but is celebrated with equal 
devotion in Delhi as well. This festival, which honors the Sun God, is celebrated six 
days after the festival of Diwali. The Chhath puja celebrations do not include much 
fanfare, rather, it is a festival of prayer and propitiation that is undertaken with 
somberness. 
 
<h2>Christmas in Delhi</h2> 
 Christmas is celebrated every year on 25th December. It commemorates the birth 
anniversary of Jesus Christ, the founder of Christianity. Conventionally, it involves 
decorating a fir tree, singing Christmas carols and exchanging gifts with loved ones. 
The main celebrations of Christmas take place on the Christmas Eve, that is December 
24.  
 
<h2>Diwali Festival</h2> 
 Diwali Festival is also known by the name of "the festival of lights". One of the major 
Hindu festivals, it is celebrated almost in each and every city of India. There is a 
legend associated with this festival. It is believed that Demon King Ravana had 
kidnapped Sita Mata, the wife of Lord Rama, while they were undergoing their 14 
years of exile.  
 
<h2>Durga Puja Festival</h2> 
 Durga Puja festival is one of the major festivals celebrated by the Bengalis. The 
festival is dedicated to Ma Durga, the Goddess of power, also known as Shakti. It is

demon Mahishasura.  
 
<h2>Dussehra Festival</h2>

Also known as Vijaya Dashmi ('Vijay' meaning 'victory' and 'Dashmi meaning 'tenth

it was on this day that Lord Rama killed the demon king Ravana and took over his 
empire, Lanka.  
 
<h2>Eid Festival</h2> 
 Eid festival has a lot of significance for Muslims all over the world. The celebration 
of this festivitiy takes place twice a year. According to the Muslim calendar, for the

Zuha. Eid-ul-Zuha celebrations in New Delhi, the capital of India, take place with 
great pomp and show. . 
 
<h2>Guru Nanak Jayanti</h2> 
 Guru Nanak Jayanti festival commemorates the birthday of Guru Nanak Dev the 
founder of the Sikh faith. Guru Nanak Dev was born in the Hindu Month of Kartik 
(October-November) in 1469 AD at Talvandi, almost 30 miles from Lahore. Sikhs 
celebrate the birthdays of all the ten gurus and call them Gurpurabs.  
 
<h2>Holi Festival</h2> 
 Holi festival is celebrated in the Hindu month of Phagun (Month), on a full moon 
day. It is the festival of colors and involves smearing each other with gulal (colors) 
and throwing water on each other. There are a number of legends associated with the 
origin of the Hindu festival of Holi. One legend has it that on this day Holika, an evil 
demoness, tried to burn Prahlad, a devotee of Lord Vishnu.  
 
<h2>Independence Day</h2> 
 Independence Day in India commemorates 15th August, the day on which India 
attained independence. After remaining under British rule for over 100 years, India 
finally regained freedom in the year 1947. Declared a National holiday, the 
Independence Day is celebrated throughout the country with much fanfare and gaiety.

The Indian capital city of delhiDelhi has a long history, and has been an important 
political centre of India as the capital of several empires. Much of Delhi's ancient 
history finds no record and this may be regarded as a lost period of its history. 
Extensive coverage of Delhi's history begins with the onset of the Delhi Sultanate in 
the 12th century. Since then, Delhi has been the centre of a succession of mighty 
empires and powerful kingdoms, making Delhi one of the longest serving Capitals and 
one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world.It is considered to be a city built,  
   
  
  
    Page-9 
destroyed and rebuilt several times, as outsiders who successfully invaded the Indian 
Subcontinent would ransack the existing capital city in Delhi, and those who came to 
conquer and stay would be so impressed by the city's strategic location as to make it 
their capital and rebuild it in their own way.The core of Delhi's tangible heritage is 
Hindu,  
Islamic (spanning over seven centuries of Islamic rule over the city) with some 
British-era architecture in Lutyens'  
 
Delhi dating to the British rule in India.
