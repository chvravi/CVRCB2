There are six questions in this assignment, which carries 80 marks. Rest 20 
marks are for viva-voce. Answer all the questions. You may use illustrations and 
diagrams to enhance the explanations. Please go through the guidelines 
regarding assignments given in the Programme Guide for the format of 
presentation.  Insert comments in the coding for better understanding. 
 
1. Mention the type of applications which can be developed using 
C language. Also, list the latest C compilers that are available in 
the market by giving the complete details like the name of the 
compiler, version, vendor?s name, DOS based /WINDOWS 
based / Others, year of release, etc.. 
(10 Marks) 
2. Draw a flow chart and write a corresponding interactive program 
which prompts the user with the following options on the 
opening menu: 
1) Subtract two integers 
2) Compare two integers to find the smallest 
3) Test an integer for odd or even 
4) Quit 
 
Enter your choice: 
 
If an “1” is entered, prompt for the input of two integers and 
display their difference. If “2” is entered, prompt for two 
integers and display the smaller of the two. If  “3” is entered, 
prompt the user for one integer and print out if it is odd or even. 
If  “4” is entered, exit the program. If the user enters any letters 
or numbers other than the choice, redisplay the prompt. All 
output should go to the terminal and all input should come from 
the keyboard. 
 
(10 Marks) 
3. Write an interactive program using strings which: 
a) gets a filename from the standard input (keyboard) or a file 
b) gets a mode (read or write) from the same source and, 
c) copies the contents of the input file to: 
(i)  the standard output if the input is from a file  
                                    OR 
(ii) to the file specified in a) if the mode from b) is write 
If the file won't open, direct the input/output to the 
corresponding standard file (stdin/stdout). 
(10 Marks)

4. Draw a flowchart and write an interactive C program that prints 
a power table for a specified range of integers. The user 
specifies the starting and ending integer on the command line 
along with the max power to compute for each integer. An 
example is included below: 
 
Example:  
Starting Integer: 2  
Ending Integer:  4  
Maximum Power to be computed: 5 
 
Output 
Num Powers (1 - 5) 
2 2 4 8 16 32 
3 9 27 81 243 729 
4 16 64 256 1024 4096  
  
Your program should use the pow( ) function along with casting 
of this function?s arguments and output.  
 
(20 Marks) 
5. Write an interactive C program to simulate the evaluation 
scheme for MCA (First semester) for 10 students. Each course 
should have both the components (Assignment as well as Term 
End Examination). 
 
(10 Marks) 
6. Write a program to crypt its input according to a specified 
transformation scheme. The transformation scheme will consist 
of two strings: a string of characters and then a string of 
replacement characters. The idea is that your program replaces 
every instance of the i
th 
character in the initial string with the 
(i+1)
th
 character (of English alphabets) in the replacement string. 
It follows a cyclic pattern. If alphabet z is met it starts with 
alphabet a. When no substitution is defined for a character, the 
program just passes it through to the output unchanged. Blank 
spaces and the other symbols remains the same. The program 
should inform the user of any errors in the transformation 
scheme. Your program should display the strings before and 
after the substitutions in the corresponding 2 files named bcrypt 
and acrypt. 
 
Example:  
Original String: I know C programming. 
String after the transformation: J lopx D qsphsbnnjoh.

of presentation. 
 
1.   Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow:  
India?s unique combination of IT skills, its labour advantages, capital flow and pool 
of ambitious, outward-looking companies is giving it a second, massive triple play 
advantage across sectors – in manufacturing, services and agriculture.  
 
Only recently have we begun to recognize the broader implications of the IT 
revolution – that it is nothing less than a seismic shift in how the world economy 
works and that India may be especially well placed to take advantage of it. But then, 
economic power comes to countries in unexpected ways and at unexpected times, 
and it is usually enabled by new technologies. When Europe began invading eastern 
shores, the Asian empires were horrified – they had regarded them as little more 
than impoverished barbarians. Europe?s growth in the sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries was a result of technological advances in building large, multi-masted 
ships that could sail in the rough, open seas. The rise of new navigation tools –better 
maps, sextants and chronometers – also allowed explorers to chart out better sea 
routes, giving Europe access to colonies, slaves, silk and gold.  
  
The tiny island of Britain emerged as a major European power in the eighteenth 
century with innovations in public finance and an embryonic stock market. These 
institutions created richly funded, powerful companies that quickly dominated 
global trade – our old acquaintance the East India Company was in fact the very 
first „joint-stock? company of Britain. And of course, the technological prowess of 
the Industrial Revolution enabled Britain and Europe to dominate world economic 
growth for over a hundred years. 
 
In this context, India has been fortunate even in its barriers. In the 1970s and 1980s, 
IT was literally the only option for a start-up entrepreneur to begin a business 
without political access or capital. A slow-growing economy also ended up 
diverting much of its huge talent into a small but burgeoning IT sector, and these 
firms got by on very little – a leased computer, a data line – over which they sold 
Indian brainpower to the outside world. India thus literally stumbled on to services 
growth, one that happens to be the emerging story for the international economy.
