Course Code: MCS-011 Solved Assignement 
 
 1. Mention the type of applications which can be developed using C language. Also, list the latest C 
compilers that are available in the market by giving the complete details like the name of the 
compiler, version, vendor’s name, DOS based /WINDOWS based / Others, year of release, etc.. 
 (10 Marks)  
Ans: 
? UNIX kernel is completely developed in C Language. 
? Operating Systems  
? Network Drivers  
? Print Spoolers 
? Language Compilers  
? Assemblers  
? Text Editors 
? Modern Programs  
? Data Bases  
? Language Interpreters 
? Simulators  
? Utilities  
? Embedded System 
List of Compilers 
? DeSmet C: DeSmet C will be familiar to those who programmed in C in the 1980s. It is an 
MSDOS C compiler. It has been released under the GNU GPL, and comes with manuals, an 
editor, and a third party optimizer.  
? Ch Embeddable C/C++ Interpreter (Standard Edition):- Ch is a C/C++ interpreter that supports 
the ISO 1990 C Standard (C90), major features in C99 (complex numbers, variable length arrays 
or VLAs, type generic functions, the "long long" data type, etc), classes in C++, and extensions to 
the C language like nested functions, string type, etc. It can be embedded in other applications 
and hardware and used as a scripting language. Your C/C++ code is interpreted directly with no 
compilation to intermediate code. Since it supports Linux, Windows, MacOS X, Solaris and HP-
UX, it means that your code should be portable to any of those platforms once you write it for 
this compiler. The standard edition is free for personal, academic and commercial use. You need 
to register to download the package.  
? SDCC C Cross-compiler: This is a C cross-compiler that targets the Intel 8051, DS390, Z80, HC08 
and PIC microprocessors. It can also be retargetted for other 8 bit MCUs or PICs. It comes with a 
retargetable assembler and linker, a source level debugger and a simulator, and it is capable of 
a variety of optimisations. The libraries are Standard C99 compatible. Source code for the 
compiler is available under GPL. Host platforms supported include Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, 
Alpha, Sparc, etc.  
? LCC - A Retargetable Compiler for ANSI C: LCC is a C compiler (source code only) that generates 
code for the Alpha, Sparc, MIPS R3000 and Intel x86. There is also a book A Retargetable C 
Compiler written by the authors of the compiler that explains the code of the C compiler. This 
compiler is the basis of at least 2 other Win32 C compilers 
? Cyclone C: Cyclone C is not strictly an ANSI C compiler but a compiler of a "safe dialect" of C. It 
enforces type safety, has a variety of checks to protect against buffer overflows, array-bound 
violations, etc. It currently works on Linux and Windows (the latter via Cygwin), and requires 
you to have the GNU compiler tools on your system 
 
2. Draw a flow chart and write a corresponding interactive program which prompts the user with the 
following options on the opening menu: 1) Subtract two integers 2) Compare two integers to find the

smallest 3) Test an integer for odd or even 4) Quit Enter your choice: If an “1” is entered, prompt for 
the input of two integers and display their difference. If “2” is entered, prompt for two integers and 
display the smaller of the two. If “3” is entered, prompt the user for one integer and print out if it is 
odd or even. If “4” is entered, exit the program. If the user enters any letters or numbers other than 
the choice, redisplay the prompt. All output should go to the terminal and all input should come from 
the keyboard. (10 Marks)  
Ans: 
#include<stdio.h> 
#include<math.h> 
main() 
{ 
int a,b,c,e; 
clrscr();

printf("1- for Subtract two integer\n"); 
printf("2- for Compare two Integer\n"); 
printf("3- for Add \ Even checks\n"); 
printf("4- for Exit\n"); 
printf("------------Menu-----------\n"); 
printf("enter your choice :");

scanf("%d%d",&a,&b); 
c=a-b; 
printf("Subtraction=%d",c); 
break; 
case 2: 
printf("enter he two umbers :"); 
scanf("%d%d",&a,&b); 
if(a==b) 
printf("Both are equal"); 
else 
printf("Both are not equal"); 
break; 
case 3: 
printf("enter a number"); 
scanf("%d",&a); 
if(a%2==0) 
printf("even");

printf("\nwrong choice\n"); 
} 
printf("\nDo you want to continue(1-YES, 0-NO):"); 
scanf("%d",&c); 
}while(c!=0); 
getch(); 
} 
 
3. Write an interactive program using strings which: a) gets a filename from the standard input 
(keyboard) or a file b) gets a mode (read or write) from the same source and, c) copies the contents of 
the input file to: (i) the standard output if the input is from a file OR (ii) to the file specified in a) if the 
mode from b) is write If the file won't open, direct the input/output to the corresponding standard 
file (stdin/stdout).  (10 Marks)  
Ans: 
#include<stdio.h > 
main() 
{ 
FILE *fp,*pp; 
char ch,*s; 
 
clrscr(); 
printf("enter the File name"); 
gets(s); 
fp=fopen(s,"r"); //reopen file for reading. 
pp=fopen("copy.txt","w"); 
 
if(fp==NULL) 
{ 
printf("file can not be open"); 
exit(); 
} 
while(ch!=eof()) 
{ 
ch=fgetc(fp); 
putchar(ch); 
fputc(ch,pp);

4. Draw a flowchart and write an interactive C program that prints a power table for a specified range 
of integers. The user specifies the starting and ending integer on the command line along with the 
max power to compute for each integer. An example is included below: Example: Starting Integer: 2 
Ending Integer: 4 Maximum Power to be computed: 5 Output Num Powers (1 - 5) 2 2 4 8 16 32 3 9 27 
81 243 729 4 16 64 256 1024 4096 Your program should use the pow( ) function along with casting of 
this function?s arguments and output.  (20 Marks)

scanf("%d",&e); 
p=s-1;  //starting position 
for(j=s;j<=e;j++) 
{ 
for(i=p;i<=e+1;i++)

students. Each course should have both the components (Assignment as well as Term End 
Examination).  (10 Marks)  
Ans: 
#include <stdio.h> 
struct student 
{ 
 
    int roll; 
    char name[50]; 
    int sub[7],assign[7]; 
 
 
}; 
void main()

    struct student s[10]; 
    clrscr(); 
 
    for(i=0;i<10;i++) 
     { 
    printf("Enter name: "); 
    scanf("%s",s[i].name); 
    printf("Enter roll number: "); 
    scanf("%d",&s[i].roll); 
for(k=0;k<=6;k++) 
{ 
printf("Enter Term-End Marks of Sub %d=",k+1); 
   
  
  
    Page-6 
scanf("%d",&s[i].sub[k]); 
printf("Enter Assignment of Sub %d=",k+1); 
scanf("%d",&s[i].assign[k]); 
} 
} 
printf("\nDisplaying Information\n"); 
for(i=0;i<10;i++) 
{ 
printf("\n_____________________________________\n"); 
printf("Roll:%d \t Name:%s \n",s[i].roll,s[i].name); 
printf("\n_____________________________________\n"); 
for(k=0;k<=6;k++) 
{ 
printf("TTE MArks:%d \t Assignment:%d\n", s[i].sub[k],s[i].assign[k]); 
} 
} 
getch(); 
} 
 
6. Write a program to crypt its input according to a specified transformation scheme. The 
transformation scheme will consist of two strings: a string of characters and then a string of 
replacement characters. The idea is that your program replaces every instance of the ith character in 
the initial string with the (i+1)th character (of English alphabets) in the replacement string. It follows a 
cyclic pattern. If alphabet z is met it starts with alphabet a. When no substitution is defined for a 
character, the program just passes it through to the output unchanged. Blank spaces and the other 
symbols remains the same. The program should inform the user of any errors in the transformation 
scheme. Your program should display the strings before and after the substitutions in the 
corresponding 2 files named bcrypt and acrypt. Example: Original String: I know C programming. 
String after the transformation: J lopx D qsphsbnnjoh.  
Ans: 
#include<stdio.h > 
 
main() 
{ 
   
  
  
    Page-7 
FILE *fp,*pp,*op; 
char ch,*s; 
 
clrscr(); 
op=fopen("acrypt.txt","w+r"); 
fp=fopen("bcrypt.txt","w"); 
if(fp==NULL) 
{ 
printf("file can not be open"); 
exit(); 
} 
printf("enter the Text"); 
gets(s); 
printf("\nBefore the transformation=%s\n",s); 
while(*s!=NULL) 
{ 
fputc(*s,op); 
s++; 
} 
rewind(op); 
 
 
printf("\nAfter Transformation="); 
do 
{ 
ch=fgetc(op); 
if(ch>='a' && ch<='z') 
ch=ch+1; 
putchar(ch); 
fputc(ch,fp); 
   
  
  
    Page-8 
}while(ch!=eof()); 
 
getch(); 
}
