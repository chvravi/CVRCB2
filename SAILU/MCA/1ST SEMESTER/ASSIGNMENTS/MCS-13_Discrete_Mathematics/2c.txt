Modus Ponens (method of affirming) and Modus Tollens (method of denying).

Argument forms consisting of two premises and a conclusion are called syllogisms.
The first and second premises are called the major premise and the minor premise.
A very important and commonly used form of syllogism is called modus ponens, which is Latin for "method of affirming." It has this classic form:
p implies q
p
Therefore, q

Another important and commonly used form of syllogism is called modus tollens, which is Latin for "method of denying." It has this classic form:
p implies q
not q
Therefore, not p.



Examples:
Modus Ponens:
If today is Monday, then I will go to Office.
Today is Monday.
Therefore, I will go to Office.

Is the conclusion always true whenever both premises are true?
Is this a valid argument?
What happens on Wednesday? I go to Office (but it is not Monday).
The argument is valid every day of the week, but it is only a sound argument on Monday. Every other day of the week it is still a valid argument, but it is an unsound argument since one or more premises is false.

Modus Tollens:
If my car is out of petrol, then it will not run.
My car runs [is running].
Therefore, my car is not out of petrol.
