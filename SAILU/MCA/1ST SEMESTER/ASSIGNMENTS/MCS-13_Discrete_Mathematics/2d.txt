A Relation is an ordered pair, usually denoted by (x,y), is a pair of elements x and y
of some sets. This is ordered in the sense that (x,y) 1 (y,x) whenever x 1 y,that is ,
the order of placing of the element in the pair matters.

Equivalence Relations: A relation R on a set A is called an equivalence relation if
and only if
(i) R is reflexive, i.e., for all a " R, (a, a) " R,
(ii) R is symmetric, i.e., (a, b) " R & (b, a) " R, for all a, b " A, and
(iii) R is transitive, i.e., (a, b) " R and (b, c) " R & (a, c) " R, for all a, b, c " A.
One of the most trivial examples of an equivalence relation is that of ‘equality’.
For any elements a,b,c in a set A,
(i) a = a, i.e., reflexivity
(ii) a = b& b = a, i.e., symmetricity
(iii) a = b and b = c & a = c , i.e., transitivity.
