There are two types of complements for a number of base (also called
radix) r. These are called r’s complement and (r- 1)’s complement. For example, for
decimal numbers the base is 10, therefore, complements will be 10’s complement and
(10-1) = 9’s complement. For binary numbers we talk about 2’s and 1’s complements.
Minimum Number is -128
and Maximum Number is 127.

Example:  
 25  is written in 8 bit register as binary: 00011001 
 1’s Complements:
 Using 1’s Complements which is HighestNumber in 8 bit register Minus Actual Number.
  
       1111 1111 
 Minus 0001 1001
 
 This can be achived even by fliping 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.
 
 -25 is written in 8 bit register as binary(1’s Complements) : 1110 0110(1’s Complements) 
 
 2’s complement: Adding 1 in 1’s complement will generate the 2’s complement
 -25 is written in 8 bit register as binary: 11100110+1=11100111 (2’s Complements).

98 is Written in Binary format as  :  0 1 1 0  0 0 1 0 
 
-98 is Written in Binary format as :  1 0 0 1  1 1 0 1 
(Using 1's Complements)

-98 is Written in Binary format as :  1 0 0 1  1 1 1 0 
(Using 2's Complements)

198 is Written in Binary format as  :  1 1 0 0  0 1 1 0 

198 has exceed Maximum value of 127 and It is considered as negative number because of sign bit value is 1.
So this is Overflow representation of Number.

124 is Written in Binary format as  :  0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 
142 is Written in Binary format as  :  1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0

142 has exceed Maximum value of 127 and It is considered as negative number because of sign bit value is 1.
So this is Overflow representation of Number.
If carry into sign bit is not equal to carry out sign bit then overflow must occurs.
